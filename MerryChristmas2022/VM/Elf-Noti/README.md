## Instruction

Every elf puts in a full day's worth of labour leading up to Christmas, but sometimes they get confused and don't know what to do. When this occurs, the elf leader will request a "noti" for the note list to do today with elf permission for any type of lead elf and user for general elves. However, I have no idea what the lead elves do, as they appear to be free all day.
